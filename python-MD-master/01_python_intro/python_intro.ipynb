    "\n",
    "Python is an easy to learn, yet powerful programming language. In general, programming languages can be divided into low-level and high-level languages.  \n",
    "In a low-level language you have to tell the computer very detailed and specific what to do. These very specific commands can be executed by your computer quickly, because you tell it exactly what to do.\n",
    "A high-level programming language builds on top of a low-level language. You as programmer no longer have to deal with this low-level stuff. This makes programming very easy and comfortable. However, in the end your code will probably be slower compared to a code written in a low-level language.  \n",
    "As a beginner, you probably don't care about execution speed too much. A high-level language like python is perfect to get started. However, please don't get the impression: \"Python is just something for beginners.\" Python is a widespread programming language used in basically all fields of computation such as science, industry or web applications."
